Basil Burgers

(freeze up to 3 months)

1 beaten egg
2/3 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup Parmesan cheese
1/4 fresh basil, or 1 Tbsp dried Basil
1/4 cup catchup
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. pepper
1 lb. ground beef
1 lb. ground turkey

combine all ingredients and mix well.

shape into eight 3/4" thick patties.

Grill, serve on on buns with tomato slices.

Note: I tried it, substituting shalottes for onions, and using pure beef.
VERY GOOD!
