Picadillo (can be made vegan)

2 Tbsp. Lard (you can substitute vegetable oil, but it will loose something)
1 Large onion, chopped
2 - 4 cloves garlic, chopped
2 zucchini, grated
2 - 4 apples, chopped
1 1/2 lb. Ground beef (you can substitute ground poultry, I even used 1/2 lb. firm tofu, and 1/2 lb. tempeh for a vegetarian version once, but beef is best)
2 cups canned tomatoes
6 oz. Tomato paste
1 1/2 - 2 cups raisins (I sometime substitute dried cranberries and apricots for some of these)
3 Tbsp. Red wine vinegar
6 - 10 tbsp. Chili powder (I like a sweet chili powder with not too much heat.
                           Recently I have been using 4 tbsp Ancho powder, 
                           3 Tbsp Penzie's chilli 9000, and 1 Tbsp alepo chilli)
2 tsp. Cinnamon
1 tsp. Cumin
1 - 2 Tbsp Sweetener (I like Sugar, but you can use Honey, molasses, or some combination)
A pinch of ground cloves
1 Tbsp. Cocoa powder
2 Oz. Chocolate (I used bittersweet this time, some times I use unsweetened. You could use dark. You just need to adjust the amount of sweetener.)
2 - 5 jalape√±o peppers, seeded and finely chopped
1/4 cup slivered almonds

Fry onions, garlic, apples and zucchini in the lard until onion is translucent. Add ground beef and brown well.

Add all remaining ingredients except the peppers & almonds and simmer for two hours.

Add the peppers & almonds

I serve it in tacos or burritos, or over rice or pasta. I have heard of it being used to stuff peppers or squash, but have not tried this.

(* note! try adding baccon with the onion for more lard like flavor! *)
