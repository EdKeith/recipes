Hot Cold Soup
(created by Colin Gerbode & Corey Fisk )

1 zucchini
1/2 large cucumber
3/4 cup baby carrots, in large chunks
3-4 baby bok choy (12-16 leaves)
2 tbsp. onion
1 cup almond milk
1/2 cup tomato soup

On low heat, saute the onion (cut up into large chunks) and the stems of the bok choy until the onion is translucent. Set aside a couple of the baby carrots and a slice or two of zucchini; put the rest of the veggies into a good blender. Add spices-

1/2 tsp.garlic powder (I know, I know, I ought to use the real thing. Someday.)
1 tsp. red pepper flakes
1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper
1/2 tsp. Aleppo pepper
1/4 tsp. ginger
1 tbsp. dried chives

- and blend until it's fairly smooth. Add the set-aside vegetables and blend again for a few seconds. Serve heated (if you're really brave) or cold.
