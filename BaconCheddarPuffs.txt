Bacon Cheddar Puffs....oh I so love these! Light an fluffy ...like air with bacon!

1 cup milk
1/4 cup butter
1 cup all-purpose flour
4 large eggs
1 cup Sargento Fine Shredded Sharp or Mild Cheddar Cheese 
8 slices bacon, cooked crisp, crumbled
1/2 tsp. onion salt or powder
1/4 teaspoon garlic salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper

Combine milk and butter in medium saucepan. Heat over medium heat until butter is melted and mixture is simmering. Add flour all at once; continue to cook, stirring vigorously with a wooden spoon, until mixture forms a ball. Remove from heat.

Beat in 1 egg until mixture is smooth. Repeat with remaining eggs, adding just 1 egg at a time, beating until thoroughly combined. Stir in remaining ingredients.

Drop heaping teaspoons of mixture onto greased baking sheet. Bake in preheated 350Â°F oven 25 minutes or until puffed and golden brown. Serve warm or at room temperature.
