Veggie Chef - Boozy Mushroom Quesadillas - 8.21.11
Boozy Mushroom Quesadillas

 

Mushroom filling:

Olive oil cooking spray

1 8 oz package sliced mushrooms

1 clove dice garlic

1 ounce beer (I used Saranac brown ale)

1 tsp lemon juice

1 tsp ground cumin

¼ tsp red pepper flakes

 

For the sauce:

1 TB fresh diced cilantro

¼ c sour cream

1 generous TB diced jalapeño (from a jar)

2 tsp mild taco sauce

 

For quesadillas:

1 c shredded sharp cheddar cheese

Four wheat tortillas (soft taco size)

 

Heat large skillet over medium heat and then coat w/olive oil spray. Lightly brown garlic and then add mushrooms, cumin, red pepper flakes, lemon juice and beer. Turn heat up to medium high heat and stir occasionally until the beer cooks away - about 15 minutes.

 

While the mushrooms are cooking, get the sauce ready. Combine the sour cream, cilantro, jalapeños and taco sauce and stir.

 

When mushrooms are done, put them in a bowl scraping the beer reduction from the pan onto the mushrooms. Use the same nonstick skillet to cook the quesadillas, but first turn heat back to medium and spray the pan with olive oil spray again. Put a tortilla in the pan and on half of it spread two teaspoons jalapeño sauce, ¼ of the mushrooms and ¼ cup of cheese. Fold tortilla over and cook for one minute on each side or until medium golden brown on each side and cheese is melted. Repeat for the other three tortillas.

 

Cut each into wedges. I like to use a pizza cutter for this.

 

For those concerned with the overall spiciness of the quesadillas, cut out the red pepper flakes in the mushroom mix.

 

If you want to reduce the fat content, you can use fat free or reduced fat sour cream and do the same for the cheese.

 

To round this out to make a whole meal, you can serve the quesadillas with a tossed salad and some vegetarian refried beans topped with some cheese and jalapeños for garnish.
